## Project Video Write-Up

### Introduction 

Hello, I'm Ricardo Rosa I am currently transitioning out of the United States Army, I've been in for 6 years now. It has been a great and successful career; I got to see Afghanistan and its amazing culture, got the chance to work with a lot of different people with different background and was able to learn a lot from them. Before starting the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy my job was to test new equipment for the army and potentially finding the best and most useful products for future Soldiers in combat operations. Now that my assignment is coming to and end I feel like a wanted to learn something new which is why i decided to join the MSSA. The class has been really challenging, at first I thought I was not going to be able to make it, but I didn't quit and with the help of the other students and the professor I've been getting better and better. I feel like I bring the soft skills necessary for a company that a college student wouldn't normally have, Once i Get this coding stuff down I will be a great asset to any company that requires my skill.



### Talking about the project

For my project I would like to implement a GUI for a fishing database. I want fisherman to be able and store their catch as well as other factors of the day like weather, water temperature, wind speed, and other stuff that made him successful on that particular day.
