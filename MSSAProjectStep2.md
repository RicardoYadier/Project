## “Notes” for a Fishing Day.

For my project I have decided to GO with a data storage for a fishing day. Bass fishing is a bit different that other types of fishing it requires several different techniques to be successful. The Fish behavior changes with the weather, time of day, water temperature and clarity, and other situations. The dedicated Bass Angler keeps notes on what lure they used to catch fish that day as well as the other factors like the ones described on the previous sentence.

I would like to implement a GUI so that the user would have a series of Icons showcasing the different types of Lures, equipment, season, weather; They would be able to choose from all of these categories and create a Table. Also, a menu where they can carry out commands such as opening, deleting, and moving files.
Anglers would benefit of having their notes easily accessible so that they can compare different days and what lures brought more success.
