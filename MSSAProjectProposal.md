Projects Ideas For MSSA Class

“Notes” for a Fishing Day.

The first project type I would be interested in doing would be a program that allowed the user to store different types of Data.
Bass fishing is a bit different that other types of fishing it requires several different techniques to be successful.
The Fish behavior changes with the weather, time of day, water temperature and clarity, and other situations.
The dedicated Bass Angler keeps notes on what lure they used to catch fish that day as well as the other factors like the ones described on the previous sentence.
 
I would like to implement a GUI so that the user would have a series of Icons showcasing the different types of Lures, equipment, season, weather;
They would be able to choose from all of these categories and create a Table.
Also, a menu where they can carry out commands such as opening, deleting, and moving files.  
Anglers would benefit of having their notes easily accessible so that they can compare different days and what lures brought more success.


Food Waste Reduction thru Donation

There are a lot of people going hungry in the United States that don’t necessarily have to.
Restaurants, Military Installations and Schools throw food away in ridiculous amount every single day.
I would want to work on an Application that could minimize the unnecessary waste of food.
The concept would be to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation. 
Restaurants will be able to see which local charity homes will be holding an activity where they will serve food to the homeless or people in need. 
Also, charities will be able to request from certain restaurants and rate or give feedback on how the event went. 
We can also create a 'goodwill' points system for restaurants to get rewarded for such a noble deed which they can use for their own marketing efforts by being a responsible social business as well.
